"Cold food, nothing special for birthday, wrong booked table wanted terrace, limited menu options, dirty toilets.",0
Great ambiance. Really Great service. Creative menu options. Good value for the quality.,1
"The host gave us an amazing table for us to sit at, our waiter gave us the best recommendations, he made us feel comfortable and helped us understand the menu. Overall it was amazing we’d definitely dine here again",1
"Beyond disappointed with the service at Mr Whites. Booked months in advance for a special occasion, but “because of walk ins” the five seater we’d booked wasn’t free so they tried to sit us on a very small four seater. When realising that would not work, they moved us upstairs, took our order and it went from bad to worse! Drinks arrived 25 minutes later, after an hour they came to inform us that one of the main dishes we’d ordered was no longer available and hadn’t even realised we still hadn’t had our starters (salad just in case you wonder if it was a tricky one to prepare). Meanwhile other tables arrived, ate, paid and left around us - repeatedly! After almost two hours of waiting and simply no service, we told them we were leaving to get food elsewhere as we were running out of time to get to the theatre (something we had told them from the start and before you think we hadn’t given ourselves won out time, we’d booked for five for theatre at 8 which, in London is usually ample time). At this point they finally apologised and said there had been a ‘hiccup’, but couldn’t explain how said hiccup could occurs despite us highlighting we still hadn’t had our food - repeatedly! Other diners obviously thought we were being difficult, but of course wouldn’t have been aware that two groups had sat at their table and eaten in the time we were there! I am so disappointed and would never go back. If you want to ensure a nice, reliable meal in London I would avoid this place like the plague… I only wish I’d read more reviews before we booked as this clearly an ongoing issue. I really dislike giving bad reviews, especially after the two years that the hospitality industry has had, but on this occasion the service was so shocking I feel it warrants it.",0
Slow service initially but improved once drinks arrived. Well presented and delicious food,1
"The food was fantastic, technical but decent portions with a menu catering for varied tastes. The staff were really friendly and good service. Overall a lovely evening and great value, I look forward to going again sometime in the not too distant future.",1
"he burger fell apart. To call something a RAGIN’ BULL, was an absolute exaggeration. I was so excited by all the ingredients: grass-fed beef, jalapeños, chillied red onion, fries, habanero mayo. But it was so bland. The sweet potato fries had zero seasoning. At least the service was nice. Too bad the food was as bland as bland can be.",0
"The restaurant is small, cramped and doesn’t feel very welcoming. The food is average at best, spiced up with truffles and caviar to justify the ridiculous prices and not actually good. (Just dropping caviar on edamame doesn’t make it better.) In total it was an utterly disappointing experience.",0
The food was delicious and service attentive without being “in your face”. We especially liked the noise levels as it enabled easy conversation while feeling part of a buzzy crowd.,1
"I made a reservation to invite some British friends and we wished to have a dinner in a good Italian restaurant. When we arrived we understood our table was in a room with no windows in the basement floor. The ambiance, the noise level and the cigarette smoke smell made us feel uncomfortable towards our friends, despite the princely but good food.",0
"I have eaten in many fine restaurants and don’t usually balk at prices for good food in Shoreditch. I know there’s a premium for the location. Moreover I was hosting two old friends for my birthday, and was ready to spend for a memorable meal. In short the service was hurried, unhelpful, in a near empty restaurant we were sat right adjacent to a big and loud table, and most importantly, the food was *grotesquely* overpriced. (I took my family of five to SushiSamba on a Friday night for part two of the celebration, and that bill was £100 cheaper than Sagardi!!) Never again. AMG",0
One of the best afternoon tea experiences. The food presentation and taste was exceptional The mariage freres teas are a nice complement.,1
"Friendly staff, but quite rushed. They were fast with bringing out the food but we had to wait about 40-45 min for our drinks, which they had forgotten. The cocktails we ordered did not taste much. The tapas was good, but the sushi was dry. Overall, not worth the money.",0
"Everything was perfect, the service. the food the ambience - we could not fault it in anyway. Great food, really tasty and lovely wine to go with it. We even got a drink on the house as we were out celebrating. The staff were friendly and waiter was great at his job. We will be back again that is for sure.",1
"Lovely meal for my graduation. Although the mains took a while to come out, they were worth the wait!",1
"We felt at home as soon as we entered the dining area. Everything about the experience was what we had hoped for (basis for comparison re. afternoon tea: Browns Hotel and The Wolseley - indeed we booked you after the parasitic hijacking of the latter) and we shall be returning. Our main server stood out as going even beyond our hopes and expectations, so thanks for everything!",1
The steak in the steak frites was very tough and inedible,0
"Booked for dinner and was told upon arrival that there was a private function so we couldn’t have dinner. Had a back and forth with the hostess one moment I was left a voicemail and then the next it was an email notification, there was just a lot of dishonesty around the handling of the situation. It was frustrating because I had booked dinner to break fast so as you can imagine it was massively inconvenient to turn up and be told you can’t eat… The waitress who served us drinks was polite and made herself available otherwise, the experience at the 8 was disappointing.",0
A relaxed but slick atmosphere with DJ set that have a great vibe to dinner. I was with my daughter for dinner and we had such a lovely pizza and the soup (Minestrone) was exceptional (I’d love the recipe!) The staff were considerate and attentive and stylishly dressed - smart cornflower blue at Reception and tweed suits for the waiting staff. A total delight and we’ll definitely return.,1
Arrived for lunch with five friends. Very impressed with the authentic menu and helpful owner who offered to change our dish if we didn’t like the special sauce. Service was a little slow but there was a large birthday party group eating so understandable. Would recommend for anyone looking for authentic Mexican food at a reasonable price.,1
Terrible experience all around. It was the worst meal that I have ever had out at a restaurant.,0
"Food was great but service let the whole meal down. Considering we had the theatre menu so we had a schedule there was no rush to take our order so we had to ask. We had to ask for table water twice and for the bill twice. The place was really quiet yet still no service and the only customers were all crammed on top of each other, so being sat next to loud swearing drunk lads was a great addition to the meal. Overcharged for drinks so bill had to be changed. Wouldn't go back.",0
Food was cold. Had a good time meeting with people though. Would've preferred food at a proper temperature.,0
Perfect place to eat if you want an authentic italian meal. Restaurant and decor was light and airy. Staff were welcoming and attentive. The stone baked pizza's were delicious and cocktails mixed to perfection. I wish i could remember the italian for the cocktail i had! We also had the tiramisu for dessert which hubby and i shared. Meals were plentiful and i will be back next time im in london.,1
"The food lacked flavour , tasted like Pataks food , the so called boa where worse than a warbutons bar and was nothing like a boa bun , the lamb chops where chewy and tasted like I dipped raw lamb in plain English mustard , the vada Pav was so dry I had to request for two bowls of chutney , the only good item was the chicken tikka masala CTM , the service was very good though",0
"Our second time eating at El Norte, flavours are always spot-on and everything feels and tastes fresh.",1
"Went there for lunch. Arrived early so staff looked after me with some starters and house lemonade. Overall food is lovely, comes fast and staff checks in often to make sure everything is ok. This is how it should be. People around us were city professionals, well dressed. Good to have a quiet conversation and if you are luck you get to sit outside.",1
"OMG - what an Oasis in the midst of Leicester Square ciaos. What a secret Find - shhh dont tell everybody - it was soooo posh and sooo lovely and food was excellent, staff attentive. Loved it all.",1
The food is awful and expensive! Tasted like it had been made in the morning and was left sitting all day! The tuna was full of gristle as well. Overall terrible experience and would not recommend.,0
"I have ordered the wolf pie, it was salty as popcorn. A very loud and expensive place with unfriendly service. Would not go again",0
"Tasting experience = bad experience Chaos of unexperienced waiters that are not capable of presenting the food or papir the right wines to the food. Food is ok, but below expectataions at this price level. Note if you order the wine and coctail package for the Japaneese tasting menu, you will get only sake.",0
"Absolutely superb - vegetarian and non-veg tasting menus were both exceptional. Best meal we had on our London vacation, by a large margin. If you’re looking for a michelin star place where the food isn’t boring, you found it!",1
"Price, quality and quantity are not comparative to similar restaurants offering the same fare.",0
"This was one of the most amazing dining experience I have ever had in London. The service was top notch. When my girlfriend was unable to take a video for a drink, they repeated the entire process for us again so we could capture this moment. The food also did not disappoint. Some restaurants are all style with no substance. But Park Row manages to provide both at a very high level.",1
Wanted a special occasion breakfast and this was the wrong choice. High end prices but all seemed a bit loveless and perfunctory.,0
"This was one of the worst meal we had. What a difference from two weeks ago when we were there. My starter of fried squid was very chewy. The truffle tagliolini did not come with the fresh truffle shaving as stated in the menu. Its the fresh truffle shavings that makes that the dish luscious and delicious. We were given some excuse about the truffle season. Ok why not tell us that when we order not when I asked when it was served, a bit late then or better still take it off the menu. The beef shin lasagne was dry. It's like its been heated up in the microwave as it was stuck to the bottom of the plate. It's just like my leftover lasagne when I overheat it in the microwave the next day. Two weeks ago there was a woman (maybe Italian) who cooked the wonderful meal. This time a young man did the cooking and he is hopeless. Don't think we will come again.",0
"Very authentic Indianan food , love the atmosphere",1
Inattentive service while the restaurant was not fully occupied. Table layout needs to be reviewed as almost half the tables have little to no view towards the stage.,0
"The restaurant oozes wifh beautiful, romantic atmosphere. I’m usually not a fan od high-end restaurant dinning since the focus is always on the food presentation and not on the flavors, however, Piazza Italiana managed to deliver both on the highest level. Definitely would recommend.",1
"Excellent food, service was slow but given it was full it was understable",1
Great concept but badly executed,0
All was grand thank you. I took a colleague over from Belfast for an early evening meal who enjoyed the experience immensely. Thank you CC,1
"We had been here a year prior & decided to come back because we enjoyed the food and service so much. Glad to see the same waiting staff were there as they were just as helpful and friendly as before. Wonderful meals. Would recommend coming here if you are in Victoria. Ribeye steak is cooked to perfection, strawberry and cream is fresh and just delicious.",1
Very delicious! We had the tasting menu and it was excellent food for an affordable price. The venue is very loud when it’s filled with people.,1
Amazing experience. Celebrated our 1st anniversary. Staff were lovely..they gave us a secluded table which had plants all around..it was beautiful and romantic. At the end of the meal we were surprised with free ice cream.,1
"Worst restaurant I have ever been! Food disgusting, prices are super high, and service is poor. If you’re reading this DON’T even thing of going, you’ll lose your money and quality of time.",0
"Door was wide open and a cold breeze permeated our booth ten meters away. The have too many staff on reception to the detriment of their bar staff levels which may account for the suboptimal courtesy, response and welcome of the bar staff. This has been the case on my past 6 visits. Food was alright, but overpriced. What should cost £3.50 will cost £5.50. The guacamole was good but served with just 6 tortilla chips ( inadequate ). My beer was the wrong brand and when I complained the barman doubled down that the Pale Ale I had been served was actually an Italian lager. There was a wad of damp grey cardboard on the inside of my pint glass which I wiped away but by that time I had lost interest in pointing out the obvious for fear of distracting from my birthday ambience. The fact that a booking for 5 persons didn’t merit table service until I asked for it was something the venue should address. Perhaps utilise some of the reception staff that stand around looking at a computer screen.",0
"It wasn’t a great experience at all, I had seen all the reviews about the bad customer service but then they said the food was good so I thought let me give it a chance. No looking back I should of listened to all the reviews, the service was terrible we wasn’t greeted when we came in we had to go to the waiter to get seated. He took long to take our orders and when we were calling him over and trying to make eye contact he completely ignored us and was making calls on his personal mobile. Then to top it off he was standing behind the bar doing a covid test right in front of the customers. When I pulled him up about it all he could say was sorry, I was in complete shock.",0
"Long wait to be served, food not up to the usual standards",0
"What an experience. From start to finish. Outstanding staff, great service, amazing food, coolest atmosphere, every aspect was just amazing. DJ setting the vibes extra bonus.",1
"I didn’t like the place. The music was too loud and the restaurant didn’t remind me of Greece what so ever. We asked not to be too close to the entrance as it was freezing but they placed us next to the door although some inside tables were available. If you are looking for traditional Greek restaurant, this restaurant has nothing of Greek! Negative experience!",0
"We were expecting an excellent steak house. The service was slow even though it was more than half empty. The starts were ok, but then the steak was over cooked which for a supposed Steak house was really poor, the quality of the meat was poor too. There was no garnish, just a pile of lukewarm chips. The senior member of staff told me to just eat my chips whilst they recooked the steak which is hardly the sort of service you expect. Totally plays on its location. Going to a local pub for a meal would have been far better quality and service, it was below average and for the price really not acceptable.",0
A brilliant experience. Was looking forward to this for months and it didn’t disappoint. Service was excellent from start to finish. Every one is very friendly and they care about your experience from the beginning to the end!,1
"Lovely freshly cooked food. Very tasty. Brilliant, friendly and quick service. Asked my kids if they were OK with spicy, as they'd ordered hot food - they were! Gave us tupperware for doggy bag. 2mins from London Bridge Jub Line and 8 mins from the jetty if you come by Uber Thames boat. Recommended!!",1
"Very disappointing. Would not recommend given the price and general attitude of the staff. I did contact the establishment following the meal, offering them a chance to put this right, but received a less that satisfactory response. In short the food and place was good, but the staff extremely rude, service very slow and food took far too long to arrive. On the night we were offered up a whole host of excuses from covid and a technical error, to it's busy and this is the time when everyone comes to eat (yes that does happen between the hours of 19.30 to 21.00?!). Only when we threatened to leave did our food belatedly turn up (we had ordered oysters to start which took over an hour to appear - I am not sure they involve that much preparation). When we queried the slow service the staff were extremely rude and condensing. The restaurant was probably half full, so why it took so long I don't know. I don't have a problem with slow service - but when the staff are rude and have a general attitude suggesting that it is your fault not there's and that they are doing you a favour then I do have a problem. Overall it was very expensive for what it is. I would avoid and go elsewhere. I have been in contact with the restaurant subsequently and one thing they did say was ""I wonder if there was a misunderstanding? Perhaps my colleague sounded abrupt due to his language limitations."" Suggesting that the service was ok when it wasn't and that we misunderstood is not the way to put issues right...",0
"Food was genuinely incredible, the best service I have had in London. The places is quaint and intimate which is lovely and evrhthing is cooked in front of you - would recommend to everyone",1
"Overall a beautiful space with great flavours. They do different sized portions so be careful - the staff will go with the bigger ones if it's unclear. The chicken tikka and lamb kabab were great, the aubergine was bland so I'd skip it. We didn't have any fish as I was with a non-fish eater but they looked great. the cocktails are overpriced in my opinion.",1
Food was very average; location is great. Not a meal to be repeated.,0
"I took my partner here for his birthday. if you're looking for a low-key nice quiet dinner, this is the place! The staff was lovely!",1
Only half the food on the menu tastes good and there isn’t much variety if you choose experience. The mocktails are ridiculously overpriced and taste poorly - can easily make better ones at home and I am no bartender,0
The servers are interested and aim to please. The food is high quality. We enjoyed eating outside where heaters kept us cosy.,1
"My Parisian colleague always looks forward to visiting an Indian restaurant when she comes to London and since we have found Kutir, there is nowhere else to go: outstanding quality and flavour of dishes, relaxing, elegant atmosphere and perfect, attentive but discreet service. Would highly recommend .",1
The food was very average - too sweet and did not seem fresh.,0
We have eaten here a number of times before and used to good food and service. But the menu has changed and become avantgarde and just too much when you just want a good dinner. You are advised to order 2 or 3 starters mouthfuls and 3 main courses. Who wants to do that much thinking!? Might be good for a special meal but we won’t be back as just too difficult to navigate.,0
"I brought a group of co-workers to this restaurant. The owner was so thoughtful and kind to organise a table outside with shading. They brought us popadums, which was great because some of us were starving. The waiters and owner (?) were super attentive and always there to help and serve. They were well presented, polite and caring. The food arrived quickly and we had very generous portions of food - I overate, but could not finish my plate! I was happy we did not get starters because I'd be unable to eat half of my main meal. Overall, this was amazing experience - the best one we had with our group so far in London. Very recommended!",1
"The Afternoon Tea at Corinthia is a flawless experience in all aspects that truly count. The food is impeccable, the service is perfect, the ambience aptly assisted by a wonderful pianist, in a word is sublime. We tried their house blend and it was exactly what is required for a rainy London spring day. The sandwiches were plentiful and delicious. I especially recommend their cucumber, their egg mayo and their coronation chicken sandwiches. We had multiple helpings. The scones were delightful and the unexpected rhubarb jam was a lovely revelation. Each pastry was delicious to say the least. The selection of music by the talented pianist, the hospitality of the team and the overall ambience meant that what was supposed to be an hour stretched to nearly three. I will definitely return as often as I can to indulge!",1
I booked a table for the evening of Christmas Day. At no point since the date of booking on 27th October was it ever communicated that there would only be a fixed price four course menu available at a cost of £75 excluding drinks per person. Given that I had several messages requesting me to confirm my booking I feel it was disingenuous o the restaurants part but to use any of those opportunities to communicate the menu situation. Very very poor custom service.,0
"Reservation was for 8pm, didn’t seat us until 8:45pm (despite the restaurant being fairly empty). The menu is very limited, and no T-bone steaks which were the only interesting thing on there. Three of us ordered steaks (at just less than £40 each): they took another hour to arrive and when they did they were all over-cooked.",0
too expensive for what it is. Food not fresh. We were massive fans of the restaurants in Amsterdam but the London branch is far from it…. bad…,0
"Excellent fish and chips with high quality and fresh fish. Nice to be able to choose for the breading: the panko is really to recommend. Being Belgian, I unfortunately have to mention that this time the cooking of the chips could have been better. It lacked completely the crunchy side. Be careful on this, it is really important Service was nice. Portion are very generous (the seabass is even too much generous). Overall pleasant moment as during previous visits. We will come back",1
Absolutely awful experience. The team rushed us in and out as fast as they could and we’re more concerned about catering for 2 football teams they had in. Will not be returning,0
Had a nice experience for my first time. The only complaint was that my steak was rare when I asked for medium. Overall I had a positive experience and would visit again.,1
Exceptional service and amazing food - especially the r gluten free pizza. It is rare to find gf pizza that is homemade and hearth cooked resulting in real pizza!!! Toppings are super fresh and diverse. Other openings are terrific. The ambiance is a little loud. Otherwise perfect date night!,1
honestly one of the worst experiences I have ever had dining. I would never go back here. appalling service. quite rude waitresses. and the food wasn't as fresh and healthy as I had hope. a lot of oil and potatoes. a very easy and cheap way to do vegan. very disappointed : (,0
Booked for two people and had to increase to four at short notice. One of my guests was a vegetarian so I needed to amend the tasting menu to accommodate this. Chef happily dealt with this request and the evening was a great success. Would definitely return.,1
"Cutlery wasn't clean, burger bun was burned & no one filled up the water. Would not come back especially as I was celebrating my friends birthday. She wasn't amused either.",0
"Excellent food, great wine selection, impeccable service.",1
Absurdly over priced and very small portions for the price charged. Would not recommend,0
"Amazing place for a lunch or even dinner……staff were amazing giving my mum and I a free drink as it was my birthday, polite attentive and very professional but personalised service. Great value as had the stunning lunch menu.",1
"Really hard to get served, I recall another table having to twirl their serviette in the air to get some service. The waitors must have been busy as they avoided any kind of eye contact for service. After getting served however the food did not take too long to arrive but not the kind of service you expect when you are paying £70 per head. Some courses were great like the Lamb chops, the rest were ok. The Sushi was mediocre, nothing special, hardly a fusion of food just regular rolls you get anywhere else. Would I return, no never. The added £24 of optional service charge for crappy service but we paid as we are British.",0
"Well run restaurant, with friendly efficient staff , food was good and delivered promptly",1
Excellent food. Knowledgable staff. Definitely recommend.,1
"Very average service but noise levels which made it impossible to even have conversations without shouting. Really poor value for the quality of foo served but you could live with this given the location. No problem with a DJ being in place but impossible to even make your order without shouting and Zero control on sound levels. The restaurant should be making this clear on the Website before people make bookings. I spent £700 and we simply had to leave as soon as our food was served. Three of the parties steaks were way over cooked but they had no interest in complaining as they did not want to hang around. I would not recommend, actually I would tell friends to avoid STK London which is the opposite experience to those in the US",0
Excellent service. The cardamom-infused tequila based cocktail was creative. The green pea cake appetizer was excellent and I could eat a dozen. The main course of char grilled sirloin kabab had potential but the meat pieces turned out to be gristly and inedible. They shouldn’t have been served. Coconut sorbet was good but not sure if it really worked with tandoor grilled pineapple. Masala tea was a bit watered down. Staff members were pleasant and prompt. It’s in the basement and has poor ventilation.,1
"I have ordered the wolf pie, it was salty as popcorn. A very loud and expensive place with unfriendly service. Would not go again",0
Poor service - bad food and high prices. Definitely avoid.,0
"We ordered 2 Sunday lunches, we only got the chicken, mash and gravy, which we then had to ask about the Yorkshire pudding and veg they had forgot about. By time this had come out we were already full and the veg was cold. Overall the service was poor and no one checked to see how it was we had to tell them. Poor service for the price",0
"We had been here a year prior & decided to come back because we enjoyed the food and service so much. Glad to see the same waiting staff were there as they were just as helpful and friendly as before. Wonderful meals. Would recommend coming here if you are in Victoria. Ribeye steak is cooked to perfection, strawberry and cream is fresh and just delicious.",1
"Service seemed to be an inconvenience to the staff. Treated with contempt until we ordered two dozen oysters and a seafood platter (for two), then service briefly improved for about a nanosecond. Our disappointment was further compounded by the excessive 12.5% service charge which if I had known would be charged, I would not have booked. This is a rip-off and is taking the proverbial when said service was not even in the room. Very disappointed will not visit again which is a pity because the seafood was excellent and well presented.",0
"We had lunch with our son. Great place with a lovely menu. Small and very busy which gave a nice ambience. The servers did well and were very polite, but were stretched with the number of people in there. Food was outstanding.",1
"As always a good service, even only one waitress, a really good standard food. We just missed the ice cream which are one of the best in London, because I did prepare a Tarte Tatin. You will see us again.",1
The food was amazing as always and waiter was very friendly.,1
"Enjoyable, faultless food, server obviously new and nervous.",1
"Dining area is literally a hotel basement room that is cold with no atmosphere. Food was average. I had steak but no proper knife was presented. Unfortunately, I would never recommend this restaurant",0
"This was the worst experience I had in London in a very long time. So bad that I am taking the time to write a review. There were not many costumers there but still the service was slow and inattentive. We waited 40 minutes for the food (burgers, eggs and meatballs). The food was not good, the meatballs were overcooked, the eggs mediocre, it was shockingly underwhelming. Let's not hide behind brexit on this one. There were not many people in the restaurant so there was no reason for the service to be so slow and for the waiters to be disengaged. It's just bad management. Brexit also cannot be blamed for bad overcooked meatballs. It's a nice location and the space is lovely so I guess you could go for a bun and a coffee if you are not in a hurry. But the rest is terrible.",0
Very disappointed with the quality and size of portions,0
Excellent and interesting Japanese and Italian sharing small plates. We enjoyed everything and thought the venue was a good place for a pre-theatre supper. Service was charming and included helpful advice about the menu.,1
Only half the food on the menu tastes good and there isn’t much variety if you choose experience. The mocktails are ridiculously overpriced and taste poorly - can easily make better ones at home and I am no bartender,0
"Went to MBER for date night and absolutely loved it! Staff were super friendly and helpful, the ambience was amazing and we were kindly seated in a private room which added an extra special touch! Can’t wait to go back and have more of the delicious swordfish taquitos!",1
"Pricing was insane, paid £15.50 for “grilled octopus plate” that had 2 coin sized slices of octopus on it, same thing for other plates we ordered. Way too loud and crowded.",0
